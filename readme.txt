This plugin will mark the key parts of a blog post so that context
based ad services can identify the post content and comments for
the best ad matching (thus avoiding the static content that is 
irrelevant for context ad matching).

Context ad services currently supported are :

1. Google Adsense
2. Kontera ContextLink
3. Infolinks

This plug-in is based on work originally done by John Godley
(http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/google-ad-wrap/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate it in the Plugin options

(pretty simple, eh?)

Use the options page to set which ad services you want to support.  By default
all are enabled, and there is little risk in leaving them all enabled.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

None at the moment.
